AirBnB Clone Project

 This project is part of our endeavor to build an AirBnB clone. The project is aimed at creating a command-line tool to manage AirBnB objects, including the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete instances of various classes such as User, State, City, and more. The primary goal is to create a foundation for building a full web application, encompassing concepts like object initialization, serialization, storage, and unit testing.
 ## Command Interpreter

 The command interpreter is a Python-based tool that provides an interactive command-line interface to interact with the AirBnB objects. It allows you to perform various actions on the objects, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting instances.

 ### Getting Started

To start the command interpreter, simply execute the `console.py` script:
Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/LynneDC/AIRBNB.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd AIRBNB
Run the command interpreter script: console.py

 ```bash
$ ./console.py

###Usage:
Once inside the command interpreter, you can use the following commands:

```create: Create a new instance of a specified class.
```show: Display information about a specific instance.
```all: List all instances of a specified class or all classes.
```update: Update attributes of an instance.
```destroy: Delete a specific instance.
```quit: Exit the command interpreter.

###EXAMPLE

$ create_user LynneDC roselinedc1308@gmail.com
User 'LynneDC' created successfully.
$ ls AIRBNB
- README.md

$ update_settings theme dark
Setting 'theme' updated to 'dark'.
